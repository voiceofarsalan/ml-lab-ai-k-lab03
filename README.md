# Lab 03 – Polynomial Regression & Model Evaluation

This lab focuses on implementing **Polynomial Regression** to model non-linear relationships in data. It also covers key performance evaluation techniques to compare the model with simple linear regression.

---

## 📌 Objective

To apply polynomial regression using scikit-learn and evaluate how well it models data that does not follow a strictly linear pattern. Emphasis is also placed on visualizing the curve and computing error metrics.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Polynomial Feature Engineering
- Model Complexity vs Accuracy Tradeoff
- Regression Curve Fitting
- Train-Test Splitting
- Model Evaluation using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains two columns:
- **Position Level**
- **Salary**

The aim is to predict salary based on job level/position using polynomial regression.

---

## 🔧 Libraries & Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- `pandas` – data manipulation
- `numpy` – numerical operations
- `matplotlib.pyplot` – visualization
- `sklearn.preprocessing` – PolynomialFeatures
- `sklearn.linear_model` – LinearRegression
- `sklearn.metrics` – for performance evaluation

---

## 📊 Outputs

- Polynomial curve fit over data points
- Evaluation of model performance using MAE, MSE, and RMSE
- Comparison with simple linear regression
